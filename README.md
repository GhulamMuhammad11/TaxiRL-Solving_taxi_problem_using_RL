# TaxiRL-Solving_taxi_problem_using_RL
10/05/2024

Hello world;

Today, I am creating my first repository for a taxi problem using RL. An agent will be trained to learn how to pick up/drop the passenger at the appropriate location. I will use Q-learning to solve this problem. Q-learning is one of the Temporal difference control algorithms. It is used to optimize the estimated value functions.
